# Postcode-Lookup
Helper app to lookup (Swedish) postcodes.

Swedish postcodes have a major update once a year and smaller changes throughout the year.
At work we have applications reliable on correct postcodes for matching to new incoming customers and for delicery to existing customers.
This used to be a manual procedure to correct and I wrote a small script in a Notebook to help out but this became very reliant on me so I decided to make a small program to do lookups.

Written in Python with Tkinter it can be compiled or if distributed with Python embedded the program can run from a .bat file.

This posted code is not complete, using a non-public API for lookup the url cannot be shared so this is to be considered as an example or reference code.
